class DaskClusterManager:
    """
    A manager class for handling Dask client operations and configurations.

    This class provides functionality to manage and interact with a Dask Client, which is used 
    for distributed computing tasks. It includes a method to create a Dask cluster of workers 
    needed to parallelize tasks and a method to interact with the workers directly.

    Any private attributes or methods (indicated with an underscore at the start of its name) 
    are not intended for use by the user. Documentation is provided should the user want to 
    delve deeper into how the class works, but it is not a requirement.

    Attributes:
    - dask_client (Client): An instance of a Dask Client. If not provided during initialization, 
                            this can later be set using the methods provided.

    Methods:
    - get_dask_client: A property that returns the current Dask Client instance, allowing the user 
                       to monitor or interact with it.
    
    - create_cluster: A public method that creates a Dask cluster of workers needed to parallelize tasks.

    Example Usage:
    >>> from robustraster import dask_cluster_manager
    >>> dask_cluster = dask_cluster_manager.DaskClusterManager()
    >>> dask_cluster.create_cluster(mode="test")

        Private method that takes the system memory in bytes and converts it to gigabytes.

        Parameters:
        - memory (int): The total system memory of the machine in bytes. 

        Returns:

        """
        Create a Dask cluster and store it in the `dask_client` attribute.

        Parameters:
        - mode (str): The mode for configuring the cluster. 
                      "full" (default): Optimized for one worker per CPU core. RAM will be split evenly between each worker.
                                        For example, if you have a machine with 16 CPU cores and 32GB of RAM, "full" will
                                        create a cluster of 16 workers with each worker having 2GB of RAM. Users can also 
                                        specify specific configurations by adding in keyword arguments.
                      "test": Optimized for a single worker. Only use this mode if you want the code to auto-determine the
                              appropriate chunk size for your machine.

        Keyword Arguments:
        - n_workers (int): Number of workers to create in the cluster. 
                           Overrides the default value determined by the mode.
        - threads_per_worker (int): Number of threads per worker. 
                                    Default is 1.
        - memory_limit (str): Memory limit per worker (e.g., "2GB"). 
                              Overrides the default value determined by the mode.

        Raises:
        - ValueError: If an invalid mode is provided.

        Example Usage:
        - Cluster with default settings:
          >>> from robustraster import dask_cluster_manager
          >>> dask_cluster = dask_cluster_manager.DaskClusterManager()
          >>> dask_cluster.create_cluster(mode="full")

          >>> dask_cluster = dask_cluster_manager.DaskClusterManager()
          >>> dask_cluster.create_cluster(mode="full", n_workers=2, memory_limit="2GB")

        - Test cluster:
