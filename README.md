# robustraster

robustraster is a Python software package designed to empower scientists and researchers to analyze large satellite datasets effectively. In recent years, the amount of data collected from satellites has grown dramatically. While this data can provide insights into our planet, its sheer size poses significant challenges for traditional analysis methods. robustraster bridges the gap, offering a user-friendly tool to perform custom analyses on large datasets without requiring advanced computing expertise.

## Purpose
Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a powerful platform for accessing satellite data and analysis tools, but it has limitations in the types of analyses it can perform. robustraster addresses these limitations by enabling users to:
- Design functions not supported by GEE.
- Access GEE data without being constrained by storage or local RAM limitations.
- Use data frames instead of more complex data structures like multidimensional arrays, simplifying workflows.

robustraster aims to lower the barriers to analyzing large datasets, making advanced analyses accessible to a broader audience.

## Features
- **Custom Analyses:** Allows users to design and run functions that extend beyond GEE's capabilities.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Enables access to GEE data without being hindered by local hardware constraints.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Supports data frames for analysis, providing a simpler alternative to working with xarray objects.

## Installation
```bash
conda create -n robustraster -c adrianom -c conda-forge python=3.10.16 gdal robustraster
```

## Usage
A comprehensive example is available in `demo.ipynb`, showcasing how to effectively use robustraster. This notebook includes detailed comments to guide users through the process step by step. Refer to the /docs folder in the GitHub repo for detailed information. Please note that robustraster is still in its early stages, and more documentation and updates will be provided over time!
